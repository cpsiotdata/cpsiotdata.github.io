## Program

Please note timezone: Central Time

Please register for CPS-IoT event, including DI-CPS <a href="https://cps-iot-week2021.isis.vanderbilt.edu/registration.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Conference and workshop paper authors must register by May 1, 2021. All conference and workshop accepted papers must have one person register at the corresponding author registration rate.

We will be running workshop virtually using Zoom. More details will be coming soon on this page.

### May 18, 2021 (Central Time)


## Background

Smart Cities & Transportation CPS has evolved in recent years to produce a deluge of data.

These data comprise of safety connectivity, health services, transportation, and mobile nodes 
such as vehicles themselves as well as infrastructure like road-side units,
DSRC units, and pole-mounted cameras, among others. Those data are extremely
valuable in determining human behavior both at the scale of the entire population as
well as at the level of individual people navigating the infrastructure landscape.

With the advent of IoT, sensor data is being generated at a pace and volume that is 
difficult to process and make inferences from. 
With several data modalities in the picture, new opportunities arise in
terms of data collection, validation, analysis, inference making. These
additional data allow for new efforts to develop novel models for traffic behavior at
different geographical locations and time points, as well as what factors are
consequential human driving behavior. At the same time, there is a growing need for automated applications to be fair, secure, and resilient. Participants in the workshop will exchange ideas on these and allied topics, including data science and open-source data sets for smart cities, decision making for smart cities, design of intelligent systems in smart cities, and challenges in deployment, equity, and fairness in smart cities, and security and privacy in AI for cities.


## Scope
The Workshop on Data-Driven and Intelligent Cyber-Physical Systems (DI-CPS) invites academia, industry, and governmental entities to submit:
*	Original research papers on the Transportation CPS concerning data with a human in the loop
*	Software tools for integrative analysis of transportation gather from multiple modalities
*	Demos (hands-on or videos) of experiences/testbeds/software/novel architecture of CPS and IoT transportation data research


We seek submissions from researchers across the domain of transportation, connected and autonomous vehicles, and smart cities tackling the issue of data-driven modeling to study human traffic behavior, the influence of autonomous vehicles on human traffic and vice-versa, and multi-modal traffic data analysis, including but not limited to:
* Novel and low-cost hardware and software infrastructure for seamless data gathering from onboard sensors
* CPS transportation data analysis and modeling tools
* Machine learning applications for integrative analysis of data from multiple
modalities
* Tools for CPS Big data for Transportation
* Novel applications to human-in-the-loop transportation CPS

Further, of interest will be papers that can direct the research community to new research paradigms, and those that can set research agendas and priorities in transportation CPS data with a human in the loop. The deadline for paper submission is **14th March 2021**.


## Submission Guidelines
Submissions include ***long papers (8-12 pages)*** ,  ***short papers (4-6 pages)*** and ***concept papers (2 pages)***

#### Long papers include:
1. Original research on transportation CPS data with a human in the loop
2. Integrative and multi-modal data analysis resulting in novel models for human driving behavior, and vehicular control in mixed autonomy.
3. Approaches to model complex decision-making tasks in smart cities and how they tackle uncertainty.
4. Challenges faced and lessons learned in deploying intelligent systems in smart cities.
5. Principled heuristics to design scalable decision-making in city-scale CPS.
6. Anomaly detection in smart and connected communities.


#### Short papers include:
1. Original preliminary research on transportation CPS data with a human in the loop
2. Demos, experience, tutorials, and presentation on software tools, simulations, and experimental results concerning CPS transportation with a human in the loop.
3. Frameworks and machine learning models for solving the challenge of integrating heterogeneous and cross-domain data in smart cities.

Submitted papers can be up to 12 or 6 pages including appendices and references. Submissions must use the format defined by ICCPS [(http://iccps.acm.org/2021/call-for-paper/)](http://iccps.acm.org/2021/call-for-paper/). Only PDF or latex-zipped files will be accepted. Alongside the camera-ready PDF’s, you will be required to collect and submit the source files for each paper – all files which were used to create the final output (PDF), be they Word, LaTeX, image files, etc.   **There is no requirement to anonymize the submissions; Authors may choose to submit anonymously or not. Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press and/or the ACM Digital Library; however, authors can choose to opt out of formal proceedings. We welcome prior work published in conferences or journals.** Each accepted paper must be presented by a registered author. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk immediate rejection. For questions about these policies, please contact the chairs.
