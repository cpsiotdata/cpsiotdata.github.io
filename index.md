## Background

Transportation CPS has evolved in recent years to produce a deluge of data coming from
mobile nodes such as vehicles themselves as well as infrastructure like road-side units,
DSRC units, and pole-mounted cameras, among others. Those data are extremely
valuable in determining human behavior both at the scale of the entire population as
well as at the level of individual people navigating the infrastructure landscape.
With several different data modalities in the picture, new opportunities arise in
terms of data collection, validation, analysis, inference making. Additionally, these
additional data allow for new efforts to develop novel models for traffic behavior at
different geographical locations and timepoints, as well as what factors are
consequential human driving behavior.


## Scope
The Workshop on CPS Data for Transportation with Human in the Loop invites academia, industry, and governmental entities to submit:
*	Original research papers on the Transportation CPS concerning data with human in the loop
*	Software tools for integrative analysis of transportation gather from multiple modalities
*	Demos (hands-on or videos) of experiences/testbeds/softwares/novel architecture of CPS and IoT transportation data research


We seek submissions from researchers across the domain of transportation, connected and autonomous vehicles, and smart cities tackling the issue data-driven modeling to study human traffic behavio, the influence of autonomous vehicles on human traffic and vice-versa, and multi-modal traffic data analysis, including but not limited to:
* Novel and low-cost hardware and software infrastructure for seamless data gathering from onboard sensors
* CPS transportation data analysis and modeling tools
* Machine learning applications for integrative analysis of data from multiple
modalities
* Tools for CPS Big data for Transportation
* Novel applications to human-in-the-loop transportation CPS

Further, of interest will be papers that can direct the research community to new research paradigms, and those that can set research agendas and priorities in transportation CPS data with human in the loop. The deadline for paper submission is **14th February 2021**.


## Submission Guidelines
Submissions include ***long papers (12 pages)*** and ***short papers (6 pages)***.

#### Long papers include:
1. Original research on a transportation CPS data with human in the loop
2. Integrative and multi-modal data analysis resulting in novel models for human driving behavior, and vehicular control in mixed autonomy.

#### Short papers include:
1. Original preliminary research on a transportation CPS data with human in the loop
2. Demos, experience, tutorials and presentation on software tools, simulations and experimental results concerning CPS transportation with human in the loop.

Submitted papers can be up to 12 or 6 pages including appendices and references. Submissions must use the format defined by CCS [(https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/call-for-papers.html)](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/call-for-papers.html). Only PDF o latex-zipped files will be accepted. **There is no requirement to anonymize the submissions; Authors may choose to submit anonymously or not.** Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press and/or the ACM Digital Library. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Each accepted paper must be presented by a registered author. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk immediate rejection. For questions about these policies, please contact the chairs.
